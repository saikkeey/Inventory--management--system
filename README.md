Let me show you how to actually use this system step by step.

1. First, set up the system:


Save all the code into your computer in a folder called inventory_management
Create these files in that folder:

models.py
storage.py
inventory_manager.py
cli.py
main.py


Copy each section of the code into its respective file


2. Run the system:

 main.py
